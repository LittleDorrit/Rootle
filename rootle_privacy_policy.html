  <h1>Privacy Policy for Rootle</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date</strong>: June 30, 2025<br>

  <p>Rootle ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Rootle mobile application (the "App"), which is designed to help users build biomedical English vocabulary through interactive learning.</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your information. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h2>2. Data Collected via Third-Party Services</h2>

  </p>

  <p><strong>Google Play Billing / Apple In-App Purchases</strong><br>
    Used for processing subscription payments. We do not see or store your credit card or personal billing information — this is handled securely by Google or Apple.
  </p>

    <li>Understand how users engage with the content</li>

  <h2>4. Data Retention and Security</h2>

  <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Rootle is intended for students 13 years and older. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If you believe your child has provided us with data, please contact us at grammarsplaining@gmail.com.</p>
